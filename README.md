# Java Student Binary Search

This project contains Java classes that implement a binary search to locate student records based on student IDs. It includes a `Student` class, a `StudentBinarySearch` class for binary search functionality, and a `StudentSearchTest` class to test the binary search on generated student data.

## Files
- `Student.java`: Class representing a student with attributes like ID, surname, given names, and GPA.
- `StudentBinarySearch.java`: Binary search algorithm to find students by ID.
- `StudentSearchTest.java`: Test class that generates an array of students, performs searches, and displays results.

## Usage
1. Compile all `.java` files in the `src` folder.
2. Run `StudentSearchTest` to see the binary search in action.

## Output Example
The output below shows how the search results are displayed in the terminal.
